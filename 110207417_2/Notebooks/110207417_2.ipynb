    "**Formal languages (形式語言)** are languages that are designed by people for\n",
    "specific applications.  For example, the notation that mathematicians\n",
    "use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting\n",
    "relationships among numbers and symbols.  Chemists use a formal\n",
    "language to represent the chemical structure of molecules.  And\n",
    "most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming languages are formal languages that have been\n",
    "designed to express computations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal languages tend to have strict **syntax rules (語法規則)** that\n",
    "govern the structure of statements.\n",
    "For example, in mathematics the statement\n",
    "$3 + 3 = 6$ has correct syntax, but\n",
    "$3 + = 3 \\$ 6$ does not.  In chemistry\n",
    "$H_2O$ is a syntactically correct formula, but $_2Zz$ is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to **tokens (標記、標誌、符號)** and\n",
    "**structure (結構)**.  Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as\n",
    "words, numbers, and chemical elements.  One of the problems with\n",
    "$3 += 3 \\$ 6$ is that \\\\$ is not a legal token in mathematics\n",
    "(at least as far as I know).  Similarly, $_2Zz$ is not legal because\n",
    "there is no element with the abbreviation $Zz$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are\n",
    "combined.  The equation $3 +/ 3$ is illegal because even though $+$\n",
    "and $/$ are legal tokens, you can't have one right after the other.\n",
    "Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element\n",
    "name, not before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is @ well-structured Engli\\$h\n",
    "sentence with invalid t*kens in it.  This sentence all valid tokens\n",
    "has, but invalid structure with.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal\n",
    "language, you have to figure out the structure\n",
    "(although in a natural language you do this subconsciously).  This\n",
    "process is called **parsing (語法分析)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although formal and natural languages have many features in\n",
    "common---tokens, structure, and syntax---there are some\n",
    "differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">ambiguity(歧異性、語意不明確)</font>: Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which\n",
    "people deal with by using contextual clues and other information.\n",
    "Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous,\n",
    "which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,\n",
    "regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">redundancy (冗贅性、贅詞)</font>: In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce\n",
    "misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of\n",
    "redundancy.  As a result, they are often verbose.  Formal languages\n",
    "are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">literalness (字面性、字面上的意義)</font>: Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.\n",
    "If I say, ``The penny dropped'', there is probably no penny and\n",
    "nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone understood something\n",
    "after a period of confusion).  Formal languages\n",
    "mean exactly what they say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes\n",
    "hard to adjust to formal languages.  The difference between formal and\n",
    "natural language is like the difference between poetry (詩歌) and prose (散文), but\n",
    "more so:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">Poetry (詩歌)</font>: Words are used for their sounds as well as for\n",
    "their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or\n",
    "emotional response.  Ambiguity is not only common but often\n",
    "deliberate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">Prose (散文)</font>: The literal meaning of words is more important,\n",
    "and the structure contributes more meaning.  Prose is more amenable to\n",
    "analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">Programs (程式)</font>: The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous\n",
    "and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the\n",
    "tokens and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal languages are more dense\n",
    "than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them.  Also, the\n",
    "structure is important, so it is not always best to read\n",
    "from top to bottom, left to right.  Instead, learn to parse the\n",
    "program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the\n",
    "structure.  Finally, the details matter.  Small errors in\n",
    "spelling and punctuation, which you can get away\n",
    "with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal\n",
    "language.\n"

    "are called **bugs (錯誤)** and the process of tracking them down is called **debugging (除錯)**.\n",
    "\n",
