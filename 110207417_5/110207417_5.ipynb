    "code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "The `turtle` module (with a lowercase 't') provides a function\n",
    "called `Turtle` (with an uppercase 'T') that creates a Turtle\n",
    "object, which we assign to a variable named `bob`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "<turtle.Turtle object at 0xb7bfbf4c>\n",

    "This means that `bob` refers to an object with type\n",

    "Once you create a Turtle, you can call a **method (方法)** to move it\n",

    "stand for `\"pen up\"` and `\"pen down\"`.\n",
    "\n",

    "a square.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Write a function call that passes `bob` as an argument to\n",
    "`square`, and then run the program again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add another parameter, named `length`, to `square`.\n",
    "Modify the body so length of the sides is `length`, and then\n",
    "modify the function call to provide a second argument.  Run the\n",
    "program again.  Test your program with a range of values for `length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a copy of `square` and change the name to `polygon`.  Add another parameter named `n` and modify the body\n",
    "  so it draws an n-sided regular polygon.  Hint: The exterior angles\n",
    "  of an n-sided regular polygon are $360/n$ degrees.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function called `circle` that takes a turtle, \n",
    "`t`, and radius, `r`, as parameters and that draws an\n",
    "approximate circle by calling `polygon` with an appropriate\n",
    "length and number of sides.  Test your function with a range of values\n",
    "of `r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that `length * n = circumference`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make a more general version of `circle` called `arc`\n",
    "that takes an additional parameter `angle`, which determines\n",
    "what fraction of a circle to draw.  `angle` is in units of\n",
