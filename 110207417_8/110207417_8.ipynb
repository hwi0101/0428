    "One is the `for` statement we saw in Section 4.2.\n",
    "We'll get back to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is the `while` statement.  Here is a version of `countdown` that uses a `while` statement:\n",

    "```\n",
    "def countdown(n):\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        print(n)\n",
    "        n = n - 1\n",
    "    print('Blastoff!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can almost read the `while` statement as if it were English.\n",
    "It means, \"While `n` is greater than 0,\n",
    "display the value of `n` and then decrement\n",
    "`n`.  When you get to 0, display the word `Blastoff!`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, here is the flow of execution for a `while` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine whether the condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If false, exit the `while` statement\n",
    "and continue execution at the next statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the condition is true, run the\n",
    "body and then go back to step 1.\n",

    "Otherwise, `n` gets smaller each time through the\n",
    "loop, so eventually we have to get to 0.\n",

    "            n = n / 2\n",
    "        else:                 # n is odd\n",
    "            n = n*3 + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition for this loop is `n != 1`, so the loop will continue\n",
    "until `n` is `1`, which makes the condition false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of `n`\n",
    "and then checks whether it is even or odd.  If it is even, `n` is\n",
    "divided by 2.  If it is odd, the value of `n` is replaced with\n",
    "`n*3 + 1`. For example, if the argument passed to `sequence`\n",
    "is 3, the resulting values of `n` are 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `n` sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no\n",
    "obvious proof that `n` will ever reach 1, or that the program\n",
    "terminates.  For some particular values of `n`, we can prove\n",
    "termination.  For example, if the starting value is a power of two,\n",
    "`n` will be even every time through the loop\n",
